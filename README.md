A client-server distributed application in Java for 4 pics 1word game.
The server accepts connections from different clients. When a client (player) starts a new game, the server chooses an image from a folder and it's corresponding word from a text file, and sends it to the client. The client tries to guess the word chosen by the server by suggesting letters (one or more than one letter(s) at a time).  
The client is given 10 attempts (failed attempts) and also has an option to choose Hint (one letter).
